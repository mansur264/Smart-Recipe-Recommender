1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a Smart Recipe Recommender System that suggests recipes based on the ingredients a user already has. Users can register, log in, enter ingredients, and receive recipe suggestions. They can also save recipes as favorites for quick access.
1.2 Scope
The system will:
•	Provide user authentication (login/signup).
•	Accept ingredient input from the user.
•	Suggest recipes that can be prepared using the entered ingredients.
•	Display recipe details (name, category, instructions).
•	Allow users to save/view favorite recipes.
•	(Optional) Provide an Admin module to manage recipes.
The application will be developed in Java + JDBC + MySQL and can be extended to GUI/web-based versions.
