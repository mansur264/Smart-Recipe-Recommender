**Smart Recipe Recommender System**

Project Overview

The Smart Recipe Recommender System is a Java-based project designed to help students, hostel residents, and individuals living away from home cook meals with limited ingredients.
By entering the ingredients they have, users can quickly find recipes they can prepare, along with detailed instructions.

This system uses Java for the frontend and backend, and MySQL as the database.

OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation: User, Recipe, and Admin classes with private fields and getters/setters.
Inheritance: Admin and User inherit common features from a base class (e.g., Person).
Polymorphism: Method overloading for searching recipes (by name or by ingredient).
Abstraction: Database operations handled through a JDBC abstraction layer.
